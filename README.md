# Pomodoro Timer

This project is a pomodoro Timer built with react and material UI.

>The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method designed to improve productivity and focus. It involves breaking work into intervals, usually 25 minutes each, called Pomodoros, followed by short breaks. During each Pomodoro, individuals concentrate solely on a single task, avoiding distractions or interruptions. After completing a Pomodoro, a short break of around 5 minutes is taken to rest and recharge. This cycle is repeated throughout the workday, helping individuals maintain high levels of concentration and efficiency while preventing burnout.
